# CONTRIBO – Proof of Contribution

## Description
CONTRIBO is a decentralized marketplace for bounties and grants within the Web3 ecosystem, designed to connect builders, funders, and the community. It enables users to create and complete tasks, build their reputation, and get rewarded transparently through smart contracts. This project aims to optimize ROI for grants, facilitate onboarding for newcomers, and ensure accountability through reputation-driven decision-making.

- **Bounty and Grant Creation**: Users can create grants composed of multiple bounties with clear objectives, deliverables, and milestones.
- **Reputation-Based Task Allocation**: Contributors can stake their reputation and earn points based on task completion and community reviews.
- **Milestone-Based Payments**: Funds are held in smart contracts and released only upon successful completion and approval of deliverables.
